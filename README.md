Sum of Array Project

Sum of array is a small problem where we sum each element of the array by traversing the entire array. When we sum an array of small size, it is not very time consuming. As the array gets bigger, it can take a lot of time. We can solve this problem by dividing the array into parts and finding the sum of each part simultaneously (multi-threading). Multithreading is the ability of a central processing unit (CPU) (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system. 
1. Naive solution: The simplest way to sum an array is to use a loop structure and traversing each item to make the sum. After writing the code, run it for the given arrays and report the times for each array. 
2. Multithreading: Run the code 1, 2, 4, 8 threads and report the run times for each array. Do you notice any difference between each case?

Input : 1, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27, 30, 64, 110, 220

Output : sum is 600

Input : 10, 50, 70, 100, 120, 140, 150, 180, 200, 220, 250, 270, 300, 640, 110, 220

Output : sum is 3030
